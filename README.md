# Patterns on LPX Novation

Group and light up LEDs on LPX Novation, and output MIDI signals - all pads in a group/have same colour, output same MIDI note.

Provides two MIDI ports:
1. `LpxCtlNote` for MIDI noteon/noteoff messages
  Uses `0x90` MIDI messages with velocity == `0` for NiteOff
2. `LpxCtlCtl` for MIDI control messages
  Uses `0xb0` messages.  The tird of the tripple is `0x7f` for "pressed", `0` for "released"

## Sections - Colour and Note

* Defined using sets of pads. Allows arbitrary, even discontinuous, sections
* All the pads in a section have the same properties (colours and MIDI note)
* No section can intersect with another, each pad is in at most one section
* There can be, at most, one section with no defined pads. It is the default for pads not included

### Properties of a Section

* Main Colour: Each section has a main colour that is displayed when the pad is not pressed. 
* Active Colour: Each section has an "active" colour.  When any pad in the section is pressed (has issued an "on" but not an "off" MIDI signal) the section  is the active colour.
* MIDI Note - the note to output

Two sections can have the same colours and or notes, but hey are still independant of each other.

## Input

The definition of the sections is in a file that is the first argument: `lpx_ctl <Section File>`

It is a JSON file.

An array of JSON Objects.  Each object, is a `Section` has the
following properties:

* pads: Number[] (u8).  11 - 88.  Pads in the section
* main_colour: [Number, Number, Number] ([usize;3]) RGB colour.  Each
  in range 0-127
* active_colour: [Number, Number, Number] ([usize;3]) RGB colour.
  Each in range 0-127
* midi_note: The note to attach note-on and note-off MIDI events to.
